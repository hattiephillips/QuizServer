2- The Question Setting App that runs from a browser- This can be found here https://github.com/hattiephillips/DesktopQuiz

3- A NodeJS server that saves the questions to the database from the question setting app, and serves these questions to the quiz app, and then collects the users answers to the quiz and saves them to the database. This is repository https://github.com/hattiephillips/QuizServer

The questions created in the QuestionSetting App will be stored in the database on a server, and read from the database by the QuizApp when the QuizApp is launched. The answers that the user gives are uploaded back to the datababase.
